==================== Version 0 =================

A user will request a etb server by submitting their email address and
local etb host and port.  

We should make sure we can reach this server before we continue.

If reachable we will then mail them a confirmation
link. Upon clicking on the link they will receive two names:

their local etb's name
their requested etb server's name 

They should then be able to link the two etb nodes using the new proxylink command:

We should also provide links to look at:

the logs of their remote server

They be able to connect to it via etb_shell (once they have the name, and
the latest version of etb-shell)

what if they need to restart their remote server?

how do we provide them logs?

what about the inevitable garbage collection problem?

==================== server architecture =================

Might be best if we have two "sites" the registration/admin control
site, and the proxy server. Keep the two separate, they will just
share a data base.


===================== data base stuff =====================

user:  email host port confirm_id

confirm:  confirm_id remote_name local_name

local_server: user_id  start_timestamp local_directory



* just to get past the  static version of proxy we need a map from 

name to host and port 


========== Ian's notes =============


Bad name doesn't 404 yet?


Make sure they can reconnect to their server with the same command...
