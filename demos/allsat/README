AllSAT Demo on the ETB (Yices 1 Version)
====================

This directory contains a simple demo of using the ETB to build all
the solution satisfying a formula using a SAT solver by iteratively
getting a solution and negating it.

The demo uses yices (http://yices.csl.sri.com/) as the SAT solver, and
assumes that it can be found in the path.

Running the demo
----------------

To run the demo, open two terminals in the demos/allsat directory. In
the first one, start an ETB server by typing:

$ ./start

The ETB server is configured to use yices to answer SAT questions. It
can also interpret the predicate negateModel, which given a formula
and a model for that formula produces a new formula which extends its
input formula with the negation of the model. Finally, the ETB server
has the following rules to answer allSAT questions:

sat(F, M) :- yices(F, S, M), equal(S, 'sat').
unsat(F) :- yices(F, S, M), equal(S, 'unsat').

allsat(F, Answers) :- sat(F, M), 
                      negateModel(F, M, NewF), allsat(NewF, T), 
                      cons(M, T, Answers).
allsat(F, Answers) :- unsat(F), nil(Answers).

In the second terminal, you can run an ETB client:

$ ../../etb_clients/etb-shell/etb-shell

And you can put the a.ys yices file, which contains a formula, on the
ETB:

/ > f = put_file(a.ys)

And start a query to find all the solutions satisfying the formula:

/ > q = allsat(f, Answers)

You can wait for the query to complete, this will return all the
answers:

/ > wait_for_claims(q)

(Note(Stijn): this used to be wait in the original README; I'm not seeing that
one though in the client; I quickly wrote a new one --- TODO the termination
code -- when is a goal done -- is not present)

There are four answers, which are triplets of assignments to the
variable a, b and c.
