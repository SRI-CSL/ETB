This example, albeit artificial, is designed to showcase the
use of wrappers to return new (temporary or pending) rules. 

We say an integer is composite if it is not prime.
A number M is said to be N-verycomposite  if

composite(M), composite(M + 1), ... composite(M + N)

Thus we have a principle of the form:

verycomposite(M, N) :- composite(M), composite(M + 1), ... composite(M + N) .


We give two examples in the wrappers verycomposite and verycompositeT
to illustrate the API.


./start 

Some examples:

q3 = verycomposite(8, 3)

q5 = verycomposite(24, 5)

q7 = verycomposite(90, 7)
