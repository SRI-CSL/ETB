==========================================
This is the Evidential Tool Bus (ETB) v0.2
==========================================

The Evidential Tool Bus provides 

See the file INSTALL for installation instruction, in particular
external dependencies required to get ETB running.

The demos/ directory contains demos of ETB: 

    - allsat/ implements an ALLSAT solver using the ETB on top of the
      yices SMT solver.

    - allsat2/ implements an ALLSAT solver using the ETB on top of the
      yices2 SMT solver.
  
    - make/ shows how to use the ETB to implement a distributed make
      tools that keeps track of all dependencies between source and
      objects files.

    - k-induction/ shows two ways to implement a simple k-induction
      procedure on top of the ETB. It shows how derivation rules can
      be used to establish a fact, and inference rules can be used
      to extract a proof of that fact.

    - hybridSal/ shows how to integrate separate tools in a 
      complete workflow.

    - vc/ shows a demo of a wrapper that dynamically creates lemmata (generated clauses)

    - blackwhite/ shows a demo of the pure Datalog with recursion but without any wrappers
