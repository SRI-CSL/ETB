Evidential Tool Bus (ETB)
=========================


See the file INSTALL for installation instruction, in particular
external dependencies required to get ETB running.

The demos/ directory contains demos of ETB: 

*  allsat/ implements an ALLSAT solver using the ETB on top of the
     yices SMT solver.

*   allsat2/ implements an ALLSAT solver using the ETB on top of the
      yices2 SMT solver.
  
*   make/ shows how to use the ETB to implement a distributed make
      tools that keeps track of all dependencies between source and
      objects files.

*   k-induction/ shows two ways to implement a simple k-induction
      procedure on top of the ETB. It shows how derivation rules can
      be used to establish a fact, and inference rules can be used
      to extract a proof of that fact.

*   hybridSal/ shows how to integrate separate tools in a 
      complete workflow.

*   vc/ shows a demo of a wrapper that dynamically creates lemmata (generated clauses)

*   blackwhite/ shows a demo of the pure Datalog with recursion but without any wrappers

The doc/ directory contains the documentation, including reference manuals

The src/ directory  contains the source code (see the README there for more details)

The tests/ directory  contains test scripts
