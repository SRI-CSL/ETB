To evaluate all of these tests do:

make

These tests rely on wrappers located in the test_wrappers.py file,
*and* the ../src/wrappers_available directory and as such, some rely
on the existence of external tools on the test computer, so keep in
mind that some failures could be a result of that.

For example  

remote_queries.py (i.e. RemoteTest) requires yices

handles.py (i.e. HandleTest) requires sal.

Currently we have the following sets of tests:

InRangeTest (in_range.py):

This set of tests relies on the wrappers in util.py and
test_wrappers.py. They test basic datalog queries.

FileTest (files.py): 

Uses grep as a batch tool to create a file, and check it against its
pre computed file handle.

ClaimTest (claims.py):  

Checks the claims and extra_claims generated by a simple wrapper call

RemoteTest (remote_queries.py):

Uses yices from yices_batch and between from utils to test queries
being handled across a network (the wrappers "between" returns a yices 
query).

MakeTest (demos.py):  Runs the demo make.

AllSATTest (demos.py): Runs the demo allsat2.

HandleTest (handles.py):  Tests the session handles using sal and the
wrappers in salsim.py.

Other hints. If a test is hanging, and you are not sure which, set ETBTest.debug
to be true (in etb_tests.py).
