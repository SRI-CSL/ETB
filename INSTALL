This is the Evidential Tool Bus (ETB)
=====================================

The easiest way to install ETB is with pip:

  pip install EvidentialToolBus

You may need to do this as root, or use virtualenv (google for it, very good
for Python projects).  This will install the necessary dependencies.

You can also install from Github: https://github.com/SRI-CSL/ETB

In which case you can install from the directory that you cloned to:

  pip install -e ETBDIR

Again, do this as root or using virtualenv.

-----

ETB requires Python 2.7.X (not 3.X) and Git, see instructions below to
check Python's version.

In addition, some Python modules are required, see below for detailed
installation instruction. The required modules are:
  - argparse
  - pyparsing
  - six
  - dirsync
  - pydot
  - graphviz
  - colorama
  - pyreadline
  - Twisted

  
MacOSX and Linux:
-----------------

Python is usually already installed. You can check the version using:

  python --version

ETB requires Python 2.7.x. If it is not the right version, use your
package manager to update it, or rebuild Python from sources available
at http://www.python.org. For MacOSX, you can follow the instruction
at http://www.python.org/getit/mac/. Make sure easy_install is also
available; it is part of the 'python-setuptools' package.

You might also have several version of Python installed. In this case
version 2.7 should be available as:

  python2.7

Git is installed in linux using the package manager or from source.
For MacOSX, Git is available at:
http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/
  
Windows:
--------

(Caveat: this may not be the best possible setup, feel free to make
suggestions for improvement)

You need to have Git available, the easiest way is to install msysgit from
code.google.com/p/msysgit.  This provides a shell that makes it easy to run
and test ETB.

After installing msysgit, run it (click the icon on the Desktop, or
from the Start->Programs button). A shell should pop up similar to the
Windows command prompt shell, but it behaves mostly like Unix. At the
prompt, type 'python --version' to check if python is available and
which version you have. It may be that python is installed, but not in
your msysgit path. To fix this, find out where Python is installed,
e.g., c:\Python27 and add the line

  PATH=/c/Python27:/c/Python27/Scripts:$PATH

to the file ~/.bashrc (creating it in your favorite editor if
necessary). The '~' there is your user directory as msysgit sees it -
you can find out where it really is by typing:

  echo ~

which should return something like /c/Users/myname
This translates to c:\Users\myname in Windows.

If Python 2.7 is not there, download and install it from
http://www.python.org/getit/windows/ (Note: do not use version 3.0 for
ETB) Add the path to is as described above. Make sure easy_install is
available (type 'which easy_install' at the msysgit prompt). It should
be in the Python27/Scripts folder. You may need to install
easy_install seperately. One this is done you can use it to install
any additional packages such as pyparsing etc. Note that Windows uses
pyreadline, not readline.

easy_install pyreadline argparse pyparsing==1.5.7

All Platforms:
--------------

Once installed, you should be able to run the ETB shell command:

  etbsh

This starts up an ETB node (etbd daemon) and a shell that allows you to
interact with the node (send queries, etc.) type help for more information.

At this point, the ETB core is now installed, the next step is to get
some tool wrappers and configure your workflow.
